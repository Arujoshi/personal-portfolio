            <p>
              I am a passionate and dedicated full-stack developer with over 
              2 years of professional experience in building scalable web applications and innovative solutions. 
              My expertise lies in Java, Spring Boot, and React.js, 
              which I use to create seamless user experiences and efficient backend systems. 
              I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy diving into the intricacies of 
              cloud-based deployments and RESTful APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond coding, Iâ€™m an avid learner who believes in the power of collaboration and continuous improvement. 
              In my free time, I explore creative outlets like photography and music, 
              and I enjoy tinkering with tech puzzles. 
              My goal is to merge technical excellence with creativity to craft solutions that make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
